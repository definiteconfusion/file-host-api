This Copyright License Contract (“Contract”) is entered between Daniel Jake Rase (“Licensor”)
and Licensee (“Licensee”).

Grant of License:
Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to
use, modify, reproduce, distribute, and publicly display the work described as File Host API
(“Work”), subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein. By use of the Work, Licensee
accepts the terms of this Contract.

Scope of Use:
Licensee may use the Work for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, provided
 that the total profit generated from the distribution of the Work, in part or in whole, does not
 exceed one million dollars ($1,000,000 USD). Any profits exceeding this limit shall require prior
 written consent from Licensor and may be subject to additional fees or terms.

New York Forum Choice-of-Law:
This Contract shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of New York. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Contract shall be subject
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in New York, and the parties hereby consent to
the personal jurisdiction of such courts.

Intellectual Property Rights:
Licensor represents and warrants that they have the legal right to grant the license set
forth herein and that the Work does not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third
party. Licensee acknowledges that all intellectual property rights in the Work remain with
Licensor. Licensee agrees not to misrepresent or attempt to pass the Work off as their own
creation, and shall credit the Licensor appropriately in any use, modification, reproduction,
distribution, or public display of the Work. Licensee shall indemnify and hold Licensor harmless
from and against any and all claims of infringement of copyright by any third party regarding the Work.

Termination:
Either party may terminate this Contract upon written notice to the other party if the other party
materially breaches any provision of this Contract and fails to remedy such breach within thirty (30)
days of receiving written notice thereof. Failure to strictly adhere to the terms of this Contract vacate
the Contract and immediately terminates Licensee’s authority to use the Work.

Rescission:
In the event that Licensee breaches any term of this Contract, Licensor reserves the right to rescind
this License immediately upon notice to Licensee. Licensor alone shall determine breach that results in
rescission. Upon rescission, Licensee shall immediately cease all use, modification, reproduction,
distribution, and public display of the Work, and shall promptly return or destroy all copies of the Work in
their possession or control. Rescission of this License shall not relieve Licensee of any obligations accrued
prior to the effective date of rescission.

This Contract constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof
and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings, whether written or oral. Any
amendments or modifications to this Contract shall not be valid unless made in writing and signed by both parties.

Severability:
In the event that any one or more of the provisions of this Contract are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, void, unenforceable, or illegal, the remaining provisions of this Contract shall
continue to be in full force and effect.
